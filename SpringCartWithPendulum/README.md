# Taylor 7.31

Taylor's undergraduate textbook asks the reader to find the Lagrangian of a cart that is attached to
a spring where the cart, in turn, has a pendulum attached. On a whim while teaching, we derived the
equations of motion and saw how complicated the non-linear, coupled differential equations were.
A student then commented about how it would be interesting to see the resulting motion and this
set of notebooks was born.

The first notebook shows how to solve for $\ddot{x}$ and $\ddot{\phi}$ using Sympy in order to plug
in the equations of motion into Scipy. The second notebook shows how to plot the phase
diagram and animation using Matplotlib. Finally, the third notebook shows how to use Panel to
create an interactive Jupyter Notebook application for the system.
